// Build a game of battling alien spaceships using Javascript.
// Earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens! You are the captain of the USS HelloWorld, 
//on a mission to destroy every last alien ship.

// Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers.

// There are six alien ships. The aliens' weakness is that they are too logical and attack one at a time: 
//they will wait to see the outcome of a battle before deploying another alien ship. Your strength is
// that you have the initiative and get to attack first. However, you do not have targeting lasers and can 
//only attack the aliens in order. After you have destroyed a ship, you have the option to make a hasty retreat.

// A game round would look like this:
// You attack the first alien ship

// If the ship survives, it attacks you

// If you survive, you attack the ship again

// If it survives, it attacks you again â€¦ etc

// If you destroy the ship, you have the option to attack the next ship or to retreat

// If you retreat, the game is over, perhaps leaving the game open for further developments or options

// You win the game if you destroy all of the aliens

// You lose the game if you are destroyed





// Ship Properties
// hull is the same as hitpoints. If hull reaches 0 or less, the ship is destroyed

// firepower is the amount of damage done to the hull of the target with a successful hit

// accuracy is the chance between 0 and 1 that the ship will hit its target

// Your spaceship, the USS HelloWorld should have the following properties:

// hull - 20
// firepower - 5
// accuracy - .7
// The alien ships should each have the following ranged properties determined randomly:

// hull - between 3 and 6
// firepower - between 2 and 4
// accuracy - between .6 and .8
// You could be battling six alien ships each with unique values.

// Example use of accuracy to determine a hit:

// if (Math.random() < alien[0].accuracy) {
//     console.log('You have been hit!');
// }








// ðŸ‘¾ Where to begin?
// Read over the specifications. Make sure you understand them. If you do not understand them, 
//try to clarify them for yourself.

// Plan the game. This is an act of simplification.

// From these programming principles (Links to an external site.)

// Use pseudo code to get a sketch of your game first.
// Avoid Creating a YAGNI (You aren't going to need it) - 
//You should not try to add functionality until you need it.
// Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.
// Often, beginning something is an act of creative inspiration to find the simplest possible case. 
//The first step is not necessarily a matter of logical deduction. Once you have a few 'clues' you can 
//follow the trail of crumbs to a logical conclusion.





// ðŸ‘¾ Actors and then actions
// A good rule of thumb is start with the actors and then the actions. What actors do we need? In this case, 
//we need our spaceship and the alien spaceships. An action these ships can take is to attack something. 
//Perhaps a ship object (an actor) could therefore have an attack method (an action).

// A repeating action in the game is that these ships attack each other until one of them has been destroyed. 
//This might necessitate a loop or multiple loops.





// ðŸ‘¾ Start simpler than the instructions suggest
// Keep these five things in mind when planning and coding your game:

// Begin even simpler than the specifications suggest. In this case, perhaps just start with one alien ship 
//instead of many alien ships, and get the code for one ship working first.

// Root out any 'gotchas' that you really ought to foresee. In this case, will we really want nested 
//loops -- one for a battle, one for iterating over aliens)? How will we exit one loop and then exit the 
//parent loop? Perhaps keeping it to one loop somehow will help us avoid unnecessary difficulties.

// When coding, form a solid and testable foundation before building upon it with more functionality. 
//In this case, is there a bug where an alien can attack after it has been destroyed? Better fix that bug 
//before increasing the complexity of the code.

// When you have a piece of functionality tested and working, commit it. Try not to commit broken code. 
//Unsure of when to commit? Commit when something works. You want to save working code.









// ðŸ‘¾ Code quality and code sharing
// From the beginning, you will be writing your code for other developers.

// Having to read and understand another developer's code is common practice. Get used to it now! 
//In the 'real world', you will be in a position where you inherit someone else's code-base and are told 
//to 'fix it' or to add a feature to the code.

// What does this mean for your coding practices?

// Use proper indentation! On the job, your code immediately fails a code review if indentation is not perfect.
// Use semantic variable and function names, and use a verb for your function/method names.
// What your code does should be self-evident.
// If a piece of code is hard to read have a comment above those few lines explaining what they do.
// Your code should be as coherent to another developer as possible.









// ðŸš€ Bonuses
// The aliens send a random number of ships to attack Earth. Think of a reasonable range and implement it.

// Scientists have developed a super targeting computer for your lasers. You now are asked which of the 
//aliens you would like to hit with your lasers.

// Scientists have improved your ship's shields. They don't work that consistently, and only improve your 
//hit points by a random number each time

// Scientists have put missiles on your ship. You only have a limited number of them, but they do a lot of 
//damage. You can say before each battle if you want to use one of your missles.

// The aliens have gained emotions and now can attack more than one at a time.

// Evil alien scientists have created an alien mega-ship. This mega-ship contains a number of "weapon pods" 
//that each have their own individual hit points. These "weapon-pods" ( objects ) must all be destroyed 
//before you can begin doing damage to the main ship, which also has its own hit points.









// ðŸš€ Bonus Bonuses
// When the game is over, prompt the user if they would like to play again, and make it so the user can 
//play again with all the values set back to default.

// So far the entire game is just one battle, with many aliens. Implement a game that consists of 
//multiple battles where enemies respawn for a new battle at the end of the old battle. Keep track of 
//points for the number of wins the player has.

// After every battle you are asked if you want to return to base and recharge your shields.

// Make the players and enemies stronger after each battle

// Distribute medals and power ups to the player depending on points

// Extra fun: style the console
// Output in Chrome console:



// You can use CSS in your Chrome console messages. Above is a simple example where messages are 
//easier to differentiate.

// Formula, use %c in the first argument to console log, and provide CSS to the second argument:

// console.log('%c spacebattle', 'font-size: 40px');
// Use multiple CSS properties:

// console.log('%c You have done ' + player.firepower + ' damage ', 'font-style: italic; 
//background: azure; border: 1px solid grey;');
